            <h1>OVERVIEW: What is this home security system?</h1>
            <h2>This home security system has two <b>main</b> systems.</h2>
            <p>
                One being the servo motor and the other being a magnet door alarm.
                What the automatic door (servo system) does is that on the click of a button on the microbit,
                the door opens 45 degrees forward, and when pressed again, it moves backward. It is attached 
                with a paperclip to support the door opening, with the material being lightweight cardboard paper.
                Its power is directly through another device as the battery pack is insufficient for it.
            </p>

                The magnet door alarm system consists of a tiny piece of magnet with the forces of 200+ SI 
                (measurement for magnets). When the door is pushed, the microbit responds to the magnetic force,
                triggering an alarm that beeps constantly until the magnet is away. It relies on the extra battery pack.
                The door is manually opened, not requiring a servo motor system.
