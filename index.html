            <h1>OVERVIEW: What is this home security system?</h1>
            <h2>This home security system has two <strong>main</strong> systems.</h2>
            <p>One being the servo motor and the other being a magnet door alarm.</p>

            <!-- Servo System Image -->

            <p>
                What the automatic door (servo system) does is that on the click of a button on the microbit, the door opens 45 degrees forward and then when pressed again, it moves backward. It is attached with a paperclip to support the door opening, the material being lighter cardboard paper. Its power is directly through another device as the battery pack is insufficient for it.

            <!-- Magnet Door Alarm Image -->
            <img src="https://github.com/R-byteUsm/homesecurity/blob/main/Magnet%20Door%20Alarm%20System%20Image%20(overview).jpeg?raw=true"

            <p>
                The magnet door alarm system consists of a tiny piece of magnet with the forces of 200+ SI (measurement for magnets). When the door is pushed, the microbit responds to the magnetic force leaving an alarm that beeps constantly until the magnet is away. It relies on the extra battery pack. The door is manually opened, not requiring a servo motor system.
